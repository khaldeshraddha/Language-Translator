# Language-Translator
A language translator is a very handy application that helps us to communicate in different languages by translating our language to the desired language. 
In earlier times, when there were no Language Translation Applications, it was very difficult for people to communicate with people coming from different parts of the world. 
Today we can create our own language translation project using python. Let’s see how.

# Project Structure
Let us discuss the steps we will be taking to proceed with the Python Language Translation project.

1.Importing the required modules and libraries.

2.Adding and importing the languages to the project.

3.Creating the window.

4.Adding frame, button, text area, and language drop-down to the window.

5.Creating a Translate() function.

6.Call the main command to run the window.


# Features
1.Translate text from one language to another.

2.Supports a wide range of languages.


# Usage
1.Run the application

2.Enter the text that you want to translate.

3.Enter the target language in the "Choose language" field.

4.Click the "Translate" button to get the translated text.

# Summary
We have successfully created a Python Language Translation Project. We used Tkinter Library for creating an easy and effective GUI. We also used Googletrans library to import a set of languages that we will be using. 
Also, we learned how to use these and effectively create a Language Translator. Now we can easily communicate with anybody without even knowing their native language.
